Step 7 Final Conclusion


Monte Carlo Simulation:
Input: Define the problem or scenario you want to simulate and determine the variables involved. Set the number of iterations or simulations you want to perform (N).
Initialize variables: Set up any necessary variables or counters to keep track of the results. For example, if you are simulating the outcome of a game, you might initialize a counter for wins or losses.
Simulation loop: Repeat the following steps N times:
a. Generate random values for each variable involved in the simulation. These random values should follow a probability distribution that is appropriate for the scenario you are simulating.
b. Perform the simulation using the generated values.
c. Update the result or counter based on the outcome of the simulation.
Calculate results: After the simulation loop is complete, calculate the desired metrics or statistics based on the results obtained. This could include averages, percentages, or any other relevant measures.
Output: Present the results of the simulation, including the calculated metrics or statistics. You may also visualize the results using graphs or charts if applicable.
